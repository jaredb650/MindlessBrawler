# Mindless Brawler — Sound shopping list

Everything the game fires. **Just drop a file named `<name>.mp3` into the folder
and it plays automatically** — missing files are silent, so add them in any order.

- **SFX** → `assets/sfx/<name>.mp3`  (`.ogg` and `.wav` also work; first that loads wins)
- **Music** → `assets/music/<name>.mp3`
- Every SFX gets a subtle **random pitch** each play, so even a *single* file won't
  sound identical on repeats.
- Want true variety on a sound? Drop `hit_heavy_1.mp3`, `hit_heavy_2.mp3`, … and set
  `SFX.variants.hit_heavy = 3` in `js/sfx.js` — it'll rotate them at random.
- **M** mutes/unmutes in-game. Volumes live in `js/sfx.js` (`master`, `sfxVol`, `musicVol`).

Format tips: short SFX as **mp3 or ogg**, keep them punchy (trim silence). Aim ~−6 dB
so nothing clips when several stack. Music as a seamless **loop**.
